# BlockBridge Protocol

BlockBridge Protocol is a decentralized smart contract framework written in Clarity that enables secure and verifiable peer-to-peer transfers across blockchain systems. It supports advanced lifecycle states, multi-party verification, enhanced authentication, and dispute moderation for cross-system digital operations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔐 **Stateful Transfers**: Each transfer is tracked with full state metadata (pending, accepted, disputed, moderated, expired, etc.).
- 📅 **Phased Operations**: Supports multi-phase transactions with equal allocation splits.
- 🛡 **Dispute Handling**: Initiate, escalate, and moderate disputes via protocol-controller or counterparties.
- ✅ **Verification Framework**: Includes cryptographic proof, hash-verification, and enhanced authentication mechanisms.
- 🧩 **Supplementary Data Support**: Enables attaching resource metadata (e.g., proof of transmission, integrity check).
- 🧠 **Continuity Strategy**: Adds fallback handler activation strategies.
- 🚦 **Throttling Mechanism**: Controls transaction frequency to prevent spam or abuse.

## 🛠️ Functions Overview

| Function Name                      | Description |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------- |
| `create-phased-bridge-operation`   | Initializes a new multi-phase resource transfer |
| `begin-resolution-process`        | Starts a dispute resolution process |
| `moderate-operation`              | Distributes allocation under moderation |
| `recover-expired-operation`       | Recovers resources after expiry |
| `add-verification-hash`           | Attaches a hash-based proof for verification |
| `process-cryptographic-verification` | Verifies identity via ECDSA signature recovery |
| `add-supplementary-data`         | Registers supporting operational metadata |
| `establish-continuity-strategy`   | Configures an alternative continuity handler |
| `implement-throttling-mechanism`  | Limits frequency of repeated operations |

## 📦 Contract Constants

- `PROTOCOL_CONTROLLER`: Controller authorized for moderation & maintenance
- `PROTOCOL_WINDOW_BLOCKS`: Duration (in blocks) for operation lifecycle
- Error codes: Ranging from unauthorized access, parameter errors, to expired or invalid states
